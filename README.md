## Run Project

It is recommended to install dependencies inside a virtual environment.

Create a virtual environment through running:

    python -m venv venv
    
and activate it:

    source venv/bin/activate (on macOS/Linux)
    venv\Scripts\activate (on Windows)

To run the frontend, cd frontend and run:

    npm run dev
